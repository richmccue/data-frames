### Step 0: Python Definitions and considerations for beginners

<b>Variable</b>: a variable is a name that stores information. <br>
Examples: `x=2`, `name="Bob"`

<b>Data Type</b>: a grouping of data values that have similar attributes and possible operations. It is possible to have a custom type, in which the attributes are assigned. These can become very intricate and are called <i>objects</i>.<br>
Examples: int `1`, float `0.345`, string `"hello world"`, boolean `True` or `False`, list `[1,2,3]`

<b>Function</b>: A series of operations that changes data or outputs something new. They look like, for example, `len()` a variable with brackets which you can feed information to. <br> Example: `len("hello world")` will return 11 because "hello world" is a string of length 11 (spaces count!).

<b>Method</b>: a method is similar to a function, but it is associated with an object.<br>
Example: if `data = [1,2,3]` and we use a method `data.append(4)` then data would become `[1,2,3,4]`

<b>Argument</b>: An arguments is a variable you "pass" to a function or method. The function or method will use it to perform a transformation or calculation. It goes between the brackets.<br>
Example: From the Function example `len("hello world")`, "hello world" is the argument. From the method example `data.append(4)`, 4 is the argument.

<b>Attribute</b>: Attributes are variables that are associated with an object and tells you information about that object. <br>Example: `dataframe.columns` returns the names of the columns in a dataframe.

<b>Library</b>: libraries are a collection of functions and types created by other people, you can access and use what they have created. <br>
Example: `import pandas` now I would have access to the methods and objects that are packaged together under the name <i>pandas</i>.

<b>Environment</b>: The place in which you run your code. Your variables and libraries are saved here until the environment is cleared. In a jupyter notebook, you have to clear the environment manually.

<b>File paths</b>: file paths are a surprisingly important aspect of programming, it's important to understand how they work. If you don't feel confident about file paths, check out this [File Paths resource by codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/general/file-paths){:target="_blank"} <br>
Example: `/home/user/data-analysis/scripts/main.py`
